# Minecraft Rehauled
Minecraft Rehauled is a data pack designed to enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience by introducing elements typically found in modded gameplay.
This means adding a wide range of items and weapons that aren't part of the standard Minecraft world.
These additions aim to enrich the gameplay, providing more options and diversity without altering the core essence of the game.
